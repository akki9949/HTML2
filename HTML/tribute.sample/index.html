    <h1>Bose Tribute Page</h1>
    <p><b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b>  23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an <strong>Indian nationalist</strong> whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. The honorific <i> 'Netaji' (Bengali: "Respected Leader")</i> was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the <em>Indische Legion</em> and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.[h]

        Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in <del>Orissa</del> <ins>Odissa</ins> during the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglo-centric education, after college he was sent to England  
     to take the <u>Indian Civil Service examination</u>. He succeeded with distinction in the first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing nationalism as a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress <br>
